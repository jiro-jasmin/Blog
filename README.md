# Blog 📝

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is my web dev blog  💻  
Scroll through the posts preview, sort them by date,  
read them and add some comments.  
You can switch to dark mode depending on your preference!  
This project is made with the headless CMS *Strapi*, which offers a custom admin panel to manage the data, accessible via an API.

This repository doesn't include any data (i.e the images and blog posts contents) as it is stored and managed by Strapi,  
which means the UI and the data are completely independent entities and should be hosted on two different servers.  
This allows more flexibility and security for the project.  

## 🔧 Tools

- React with Next.js
- Strapi CMS
- Sass (SCSS)
- Axios for static generation with default data
- SWR for client-side data fetching
- Markdown-it, a markdown parser when uploading data from the panel (from *.md* to *.html*)
- Next-themes, a dark/light theme toggler that doesn't glitch on page load 😍

## 🪄 Features

- Static pages generated by Next.js for SEO
- Calls the Strapi API on each load for fresh data
- Custom panel made with Strapi to easily add new content
- Theme toggler (based on system preference)
- Material Design inspired UI
- Client-side form data validation when uploading a comment

## ⚠️ If you download this repository, make sure to  

### 1. Download Next.js and the dependencies listed in *package-lock.json*

### 2. Download Strapi and add your own data (with the same content type to access it!)
Please note that you will need to create a dotenv (*.env*) file with the variable of your own Strapi public URL!

## 🔮 On the future of this project  
  
Please note that this project will have some improvements in the near future. 
For instance, I am thinking of associating each post with #tags, which could lead to a new Search feature based on these tags.  
Also for now, I have used a "honeypot" kind of method to prevent bot from commenting, but if this is not a satisfying solution, I might just add a CAPTCHA.  
If you have any suggestion or question regarding this project, do not hesitate to let me know! 😊
